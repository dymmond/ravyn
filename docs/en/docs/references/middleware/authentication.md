# **`AuthenticationMiddleware`** class

This is the reference for the main object `AuthenticationMiddleware` that contains all the parameters,

This is **also the newest way of performing authentication** in Ravyn, and it is recommended to use
this class instead of `BaseAuthMiddleware` for new projects.
